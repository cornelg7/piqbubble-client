# Comment policy

Hey there, welcome!

We want to create a positive and welcoming space for everyone here, so we do our best to keep the trolls, spammers, and abusers away. However, we can't be everywhere at once, so please help us keep the comments section a great place to interact with fellow readers.

To make sure we all have a good time here, we ask that you follow these guidelines:
- Be kind and respectful to others. Treat others as you'd like to be treated, and remember that everyone here is a real person behind their screen.
- Avoid trolling. Constructive criticism is always welcome, but comments that are just plain mean or unhelpful will be removed.
- No spam allowed. While we're happy to hear about your success stories, we kindly ask that you keep them to yourself. Let's keep the focus on our discussion topic.

In a nutshell, our guidelines are pretty simple: "Don't be a jerk." If you don't follow these guidelines, our moderators may remove your comments or even ban you from participating in the discussion.

If you come across any comments that don't meet our guidelines, please feel free to flag them or mark them as spam. We really appreciate your help in making this a friendly and positive space for everyone!

Thanks for joining us, and happy commenting!
