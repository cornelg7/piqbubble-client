Sked24 is a large, versatile product that medical providers all across Chile use for managing time, handling physicians, scheduling appointments, and more.

I've been working with the Sked24 team since 2020. In my time here, I implemented and improved multiple features, some of which can be seen below.

- Implemented and optimized the new version of the patient app used to book over 500K appointments each month

- Vastly improved developer experience and code efficiency by writing AutoHotkey scripts for the team
- Built an easy-to-use PDF + Image viewer with features such as zooming, rotating, and printing

- Reduced Jasmine test times by analyzing and optimizing the tests
- Implemented complex filters logic for searching appointment slots
- Added a lite version for one of the libraries created by the company by utilizing the same codebase and NPM scripts
- Implemented multiple calendars for scheduling with FullCalendar
- Built a developer- and user- friendly interface from scratch for managing configurations with reusable and consistent components
- Greatly reduced the development time for a feature type by utilizing Angular Schematics
