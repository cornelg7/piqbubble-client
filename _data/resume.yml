      <br>
      As an Angular developer within a product-centered small agile team, I work closely with the back-end team to bring the API to life.
      In the bi-weekly meetings, we discuss the implementation of new long-lasting features and the best way to maintain the product.
    responsibilities:
      - "Work closely with the RESTful API by building OData queries and mapping JSON requests and responses"
      - "Build consistent interface designs with a focus on user experience, responsiveness, and legacy browser support"
      - "Follow current and company best practices in regards to, but not limited to, Git version control naming, ESLint / TSLint configurations, code in general"
      - "Apply the scout rule on a daily basis: 'Always leave the code better than you found it'"
      - "Manage NPM packages and retention rules on MyGet"
      - "Closely review teammates' pull requests and improve upon them by asking deep related questions and helping out when possible"
      - "Publish changes directly to the clients with TeamCity and Octopus Deploy"
    highlights:
      - "Implemented and optimized the new version of the patient app used to book over 500K appointments each month"
      - "Vastly improved developer experience and code efficiency by writing AutoHotkey scripts for the team"
      - "Built an easy-to-use PDF + Image viewer with features such as zooming, rotating, and printing"
      - "Reduced Jasmine test times by analyzing and optimizing the tests"
      - "Implemented complex filters logic for searching appointment slots"
      - "Added a lite version for one of the libraries created by the company by utilizing the same codebase and NPM scripts"
      - "Implemented multiple calendars for scheduling with FullCalendar"
      - "Built a developer- and user- friendly interface from scratch for managing configurations with reusable and consistent components"
